# post-grad-job-analysis

### meaning behind it all

Finding a job isn't easy. 

1. Apply to newly posted positions. 
   - Less than one week old and have fewer applicants.
   - Don't spend too much time on one application, unless you are really interested, don't bother.
  
2. Keep upskilling and practicing for interviews.
3. Utilize your connections and take any relevant opportunities.

Persistence is key. At the same time, take steps to optimize your effort.

I applied to 277 positions (from when I started counting) and got 4 offers out of it. My ghost rate was 67%, rejection rate was 31%, and offer rate of 1.4%. To job seekers, there are many people who have experienced what you are right now!

### time line

after graudation I worked at Toyota Racing Development as a software engineering intern for 12 week. I finished those 12 weeks on 8/24/2022. I signed an offer at Wiliot on 11/10/2022. 78 days.

### data collection

I kept track of all my applications in a chrome extension called Simplify. this extension also helps autofil boilerplate information for job apps. I built a scraper to collect data from the webpage using my simplify-job-scraper script. this data is stored in the jobs.csv file


### notes

plotly is nice, kinda wished i was using it earlier. I like that it ties into JS. also the fact it is  interactive and can import from ggplot2
